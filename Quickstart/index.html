<p>Some simple, basic things to get you started hacking some AppleTV apps. Most of these files will need some editing to work properly for you (server URLs, etc.).</p>

<ul>
<li><a href='addsite.mc'>addsite.mc</a> - Adds the "Add Site" application to the main AppleTV Screen</li>
<li><a href='feature.mc'>feature.mc</a> - Adds some hidden features: EnableFeatureEnabler, PrintBitRate, Home Sharing diagnostics</li>
<li><a href='mitm.mc'>mitm.mc</a> - Sets up a WiFi network with a proxy, suitable for intercepting traffic (like Burp suite or mitmproxy).</li>
<li><a href='bag.plist.xml'>bag.plist.xml</a> - Basic AppleTV app configuration file. You'll need to rename it just bag.plist (and move the other one out of the way) to get this to load on the AppleTV).</li>
<li><a href='bag.plist'>bag.plist</a> - A real bag.plist for the original AppleTV Trailers app (fetched from http://trailers.apple.com/appletv/bag.plist)</li>
<li><a href='debug.log'>debug.log</a> - The debug log that gets collected when the AddSite profile is installed (and configured to point at this server).</li>
</ul>
